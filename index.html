	<p>I am a freelance maths education consultant with particular interest and expertise in edtech. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-cutbill/">My LinkedIn page</a> has more information about my experience and what I currently do for clients.</p>
	<p>In addition to my freelance work I am the founder of <a href="http://oughtred.xyz/">Oughtred</a>, a project I hope to return to in the future but which is probably best thought of as vaporware for the moment.</p>
	<p>I occasionally tweet about maths and maths education as <a href="https://twitter.com/intersectarian">@intersectarian</a> and even more occasionally I write something more substantial on <a href="https://medium.com/@intersectarian">Medium</a>.</p>
	<p>Aside from work, I am the treasurer of <a href="http://www.purleyoverseas.org/">a small grant-giving charity</a> and sing in a number of local choirs.</p>
	<p>Feel free to get in touch by <a href="mailto:alex.cutbill@gmail.com">email</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-cutbill/">LinkedIn message</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/intersectarian">Twitter DM</a> if you'd like to chat for any reason. I don't bite!</p>
